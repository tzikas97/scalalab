        most active development during jEdit 4.3. Some of them influenced the
        development of the jEdit core, and others are good enough to be
        incorporated into the core, but are left as separate plugins simply
        because it makes it easier for us to maintain and debug them.</p><p>The latest version of <span class="bold"><strong>Console</strong></span>
		has many improvements, and takes advantage of new features of jEdit. </p><p>Navigator, providing a navigable history, is new and improved - it
        provides the user with Eclipse-like Navigation to previous locations,
        for each TextArea of each View. It uses new EditBus messages which
        are now available in the public API, PositionChanging and
        BufferChanging.</p><h2><a name="id400187"></a>ProjectViewer</h2><p>For managing groups of files and organizing them into trees,
        ProjectViewer is very useful. It's been under active development, and
        many bugs are fixed quickly after they are found. Its ability to filter
        its input set based on regular expressions or the contents of
        CVS/SVN/Perforce entries makes it especially handy for other plugins
        that use it, such as <span class="bold"><strong>FastOpen</strong></span> and
        <span class="bold"><strong>OpenIt</strong></span>, both of which are also recently
        updated for 4.3.</p><p>ProjectViewer is also very important for language plugins that
        want to deal with file sets. It defines a project-wide property
        specification, that makes it possible to have different settings
        depending on what the active project is.</p><h2><a name="id400223"></a>SideKicks and Language Plugins</h2><p>SideKick has been debugged and the documentation has been
        improved. Further, there is a new combobox that lets you choose your
        parser, and a new SplitPane to show you the contents of the hovered
        element. The combobox is especially important since there are multiple
        parsers that can be used on a given file, especially when you are
        working with Python, PHP, HTML, XML, or JavaScript files.</p><p>Many language-specific plugins have been redesigned to use the new
        and improved SideKick. In particular, CtagsSideKick (a replacement for
        CodeBrowser), JPyDebug, JythonInterpreter, RubyPlugin, PHPParser,
        JavaSideKick, XML, and PerlSideKick. Be sure to try them out.</p><p>In case you're looking for JavaCore, JBrowse, CodeAid,
        DotComplete, or PropertySideKick, they have all been merged (in terms of
        functionality) into the new JavaSideKick plugin. Some other plugins that
		depend on these above plugins still need to be converted to use
		JavaSideKick instead of the old java plugins listed above. </p><p>As for HtmlSideKick, JavaScriptSideKick, and XmlIndenter, they
        have all been merged into the new XML 2 plugin, which now includes two
        parsers for CSS, one for Ecmascript, and completion popups for elements
        and attributes in XML, CSS, and HTML.</p><p>If you use many different languages, you should also try out the
        very clever ContextMenu plugin. </p><p>The SVNPlugin is new, and the JDiff plugin is improved. Many
		other plugins have latest versions that require jEdit 4.3. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="dockable-interface.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="futureplans.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Dockable Interface </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 5. Future Plans</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
