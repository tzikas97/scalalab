You can use some useful ScalaLab functionality (e.g. plotting)
from the Java9's JShell scripting engine.


In order to do that:

1. Start the JShell with

jshell --class-path ScalaLab.jar

2. Open the script with some appropriate import statements, makeImportsJShell.jshell
from with JShell, i.e.


/open  makeImportsJShell.jshell

3. Then use ScalaLab's functionality from Java 9, e.g.

 Vec v = vrand(60000);
 plot(v);
